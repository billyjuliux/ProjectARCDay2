                Aloha, I'm Billy, a student who loves music and imagination! Born on 22nd July 2001, I am now 18 years old.
                My dream is to become one of the wheel which could move the world! I hope that I can be a person who can 
                bring a positive impact onto the world of technology.
                <br><br>
                Currently studying at ITB, I am learning as many skill as possible - one of them is web development. 
                As I join the ARC, I hope that I can improve my skill in the web development section.
                Having no information on how to create a website, I dedicate myself to keep on learning until I am able to produce a fine site.

                Truthfully, the time I started to deepen my programming skills is when I started studying in university - STEI ITB, which is the Phyton Language.
                Although, I have learnt some programming languages in my senior high school, such as Visual Basics and Java,
                but I only understand the basics. In addition, I am now learning the C# language as I join the Game Development HMIF Bootcamp.
                <br>
                Summing up, these are the languages that I did learn.

                Until this moment, in fact, I haven't got any work or creation done involving the web development.
                This ARC Day-1 Project is the first website that I created, starting from zero.
                However, I am eager to learn this interesting thing and I hope that I can create something soon!
                <br><br>
                But besides web development, I actually joined the Game Development HMIF Bootcamp and did make a simple game.
                Here are some screenshots of the platformer game I made.
